- [Custom password configurations](/knowledge-base/custom-password-configuration) provide greater control over password requirements for users of your applications.
- Changed JWT signing algorithm to RS256. Developers can now download and cache the public key to validate the JWT signature to prove the token was generated by OrderCloud.
- ApiClient level Role management enhancement. User roles included in the JWT can optionally be managed as an intersection of ApiClient and SecurityProfile instead of populating the scope parameter of the token request.
- In accordance with Open Source Foundation for Application Security (OWASP) there are now less explicit error messages returned for failed user logins.
