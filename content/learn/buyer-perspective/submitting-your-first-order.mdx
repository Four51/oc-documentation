In the previous guides you created an empty order and then populated it with a line item containing two of our Cotton T-shirt product.

## Shipping Estimates
In a normal order checkout process, one would expect to provide a shipping address and thereby have a choice of shipping providers to choose from. This is what the **Shipping Estimates** integration is for and will be covered in later documentation.

## Order Calculate
When a Shipper is selected or pre-configured by the application, at that point a **Order Calculate** would be run to update `ShippingCost` and `TaxCost` using a third party provider and elevated API roles. Again, this is beyond the scope of this guide and covered in later documentation.

## Submitting the Order
Once you have an order with at least one Line Item, you are able to use the **Order Submit** endpoint to change the Order's status from `Unsubmitted` to `Open`. Wherein the seller perspective or automation would take over fulfillment.

<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `POST https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/orders/Outgoing/INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE/submit HTTP/1.1
Authentication: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`,
javascript: `import { Tokens, Orders } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Tokens.Set("INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE")\n
var orderId = "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE";\n
Orders.Submit("Outgoing", orderId)
  .then(response => {
      // returns the submitted order object
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(err => console.log(err));\n
})
.catch(err => console.log(err));`,
typescript: `import { Tokens, Orders, Order, OrderCloudError } from "ordercloud-javascript-sdk";\n
Tokens.Set("INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE")\n
const orderId:string = "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE";\n
Orders.Submit("Outgoing", orderId)
  .then((response: Order) => {
      // returns the submitted order object
      console.log(response);
  })
  .catch((err:OrderCloudError) => console.log(err));`,
csharp: `using OrderCloud.SDK;\n
// see previous example for configuring OrderCloudClient
var client = new OrderCloudClient(...);\n
Order response = await client.Orders.SubmitAsync("Outgoing", "INSERT_ORDER_ID_HERE");`}}
/>

The response should look something like this:

```json
{
	"ID": "PKTiEFNEiEi9mEmC9cZCrw",
	"FromUser": {
		"ID": "BUYER_USER",
		"Username": "buyer01",
		"Password": null,
		"FirstName": "Buyer",
		"LastName": "User",
		"Email": "buyer@email.com",
		"Phone": null,
		"TermsAccepted": null,
		"Active": true,
		"xp": null,
		"AvailableRoles": null,
		"DateCreated": "2021-02-08T23:09:14.82+00:00",
		"PasswordLastSetDate": "2021-02-08T23:10:00.56+00:00"
	},
	"FromCompanyID": "BUYER_ORGANIZATION",
	"ToCompanyID": "bClEeDV0f9GjjkGD",
	"FromUserID": "BUYER_USER",
	"BillingAddressID": null,
	"BillingAddress": null,
	"ShippingAddressID": null,
	"Comments": null,
	"LineItemCount": 1,
	"Status": "Open",
	"DateCreated": "2021-02-23T20:39:03.173+00:00",
	"DateSubmitted": "2021-03-01T22:37:59.267+00:00",
	"DateApproved": null,
	"DateDeclined": null,
	"DateCanceled": null,
	"DateCompleted": null,
	"Subtotal": 20,
	"ShippingCost": 0,
	"TaxCost": 0,
	"PromotionDiscount": 0,
	"Total": 20,
	"IsSubmitted": true,
	"xp": null
}
```

The order now has `IsSubmitted` set to true, `Status` is set to "Open", and the `DateSubmitted` property has been set.

Congratulations on submitting your first OrderCloud order! In the next chapter we will cover how the seller perspective can view this order and take it through the fulfillment process.
