OrderCloud provides a robust set of features for creating, organizing, and presenting product catalogs. For most, OrderCloud is not the master record for such data, and a significant effort is required to keep this data synchronized. But in a smaller subset of cases, sellers are already equipped not just with back-office product data but with full browsing and search capabilities for their buyers. All they're missing are the purchasing and order management features. In these cases, an integrator can leverage OrderCloud's Ad-Hoc Products feature to provide product data on demand and skip the cumbersome data synchronization effort entirely. Let's take a look at how it works.

## The `AddToCart` Integration Event

The first step in integrating an external product catalog with OrderCloud orders is implementing an HTTP service that provides product data via a well-defined RESTful API. Specifically, OrderCloud has defined a new Integration Event type: `AddToCart`. Once [defined](https://ordercloud.io/api-reference/seller/integration-events/create) and [assigned to an `ApiClient`](https://ordercloud.io/api-reference/seller/api-clients/patch) via the `AddToCartIntegrationEventID` property, whenever a Buyer User adds a line item to an unsubmitted order, OrderCloud will send a `POST` request to the configured endpoint with a payload like the following:

```json
{
  "ProductID": "XYZ-123",
  "Quantity": 2,
  "BuyerID": "BUYER-X",
  "BuyerUser": { ... },
  "SellerID": "SELLER-Y",
  "Environment": "Production",
  "OrderCloudAccessToken": "6MNTg0TM3Cwi...",
  "ConfigData": { }
}
```

`ProductID` and `Quantity` are what you'll typically use to look up the product and its price in the external system; other fields are provided mostly for authentication and identification purposes. `BuyerUser` contains all the same fields as the [response of a buyer user GET request](https://ordercloud.io/api-reference/buyers/users/get#response-body).

Your configured endpoint is expected to return an HTTP 200 response with a body like the following:

```json
{
  "Product": {
    "ID": "XYZ-123",
    "Name": "My Ad-Hoc Product",
    "Description": "blah blah blah",
    "QuantityMultiplier": 1,
    "ShipWeight": 123,
    "ShipHeight": 456,
    "ShipWidth": 123,
    "ShipLength": 456,
    "DefaultSupplierID": null,
    "Returnable": false,
    "xp": { }
  },
  "UnitPrice": 9.99
}
```

Most fields are optional and are in fact validated in much the same way as [creating a new cataloged product](https://ordercloud.io/api-reference/product-catalogs/products/create#request-body) in terms of required fields, max string lengths, etc.
