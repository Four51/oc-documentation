### Available Feeds

Stay up to date with the most recent OrderCloud API and Portal releases with RSS feeds.
- [API Release Notes RSS](https://ordercloud.io/rss/release-notes.xml)
- [Portal Release Notes RSS](https://ordercloud.io/rss/portal-release-notes.xml)

### Suggested Use Cases

#### There are several ways to consume RSS feeds, here are some of the ways we suggest.

1. Receive updates in Slack
    - Add the RSS app to your Slack workspace.  The RSS app will fetch feeds periodically and post updates to the specified channel.
    Learn more [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack).
1. Use a desktop feed reader
    - While there are a lot of desktop RSS readers on the market, a great and free option is [feedly.com](https://www.feedly.com).
    There is also a Google Chrome extension for Feedly that allows you to detect and subscribe to RSS feeds.

### Future Development

In an effort to keep the community well informed, it is possible that we expand RSS feeds to include the Knowledge Base Guides and Articles.
