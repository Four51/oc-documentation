Price schedules offer many ways to price your products, please refer to <Link to="/knowledge-base/sale-prices">Sale Prices</Link> and <Link to="knowledge-base/same-product-multiple-price-schedules">Same Product, Multiple Price Schedules</Link> prior to following this example. 

There are multiple ways to price your products with price schedules, lets take a look at an example scenario below.

> Using the examples from <Link to="knowledge-base/same-product-multiple-price-schedules">Same Product, Multiple Price Schedules</Link>, I want to provide a time based sale price to the **"ProductID": "usb-product-id"** product.

After reviewing the considerations below, lets go through the steps of acheiving this!

## Considerations

1. In our example, we will be modifying price schedules that were created in the previous example. If you follow those steps the required products, categories and catalogs have been created successfully, with proper assignments.

## Modify the Price Schedules

From the previous example, we should have two price schedules for the "USB Cord" product.

Lets check to ensure the PriceSchedules exist

Our calls to the OrderCloud API should look like this (If successful, our call should return a `200` response and the PriceSchedule):

<CodeExample
  title="Verify PriceSchedules exist"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/enterprise-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`
}}
/>

<CodeExample
  title="Verify PriceSchedules exist"
  content={{
    http: `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/startup-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8;`
}}
/>

## Add Sale Pricing for each PriceSchedule

Now that we have determined that both the `PriceSchedule`s exist, lets add some sale pricing with some date and time restrictions.
For this next step, we will assign a `SalePrice`, `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` values for `enterprise-priceschedule-id`.
Lets assign a `SalePrice` of **2.99** for a 1 month duration starting from now.
> Note: Modify the `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` dates to be valid for your scenario.
> Note: As `SaleStart` is optional, by not setting a value for `SaleStart` the `SalePrice` would be valid immediately (As long as the `SaleEnd` date is in the future).

<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `PATCH https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/enterprise-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n
{
  "SaleStart": "2022-03-03T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "SaleEnd": "2022-04-03T00:00:00.00+00:00"
  "PriceBreaks": [
    {
      "Quantity": 1,
      "Price": 3.99,
      "SalePrice": 2.99
    }
  ]
}`
}}
/>

For this next step, lets assign a `SalePrice` and `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` values for `startup-priceschedule-id`.
Lets assign a `SalePrice` of **4.99** for a 1 month duration starting from next month.
**Note:** Modify the `SaleStart` and `SaleEnd` dates to be valid for your scenario.

<CodeExample
  content={{
    http: `PATCH https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/priceschedules/startup-priceschedule-id HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer INSERT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n
{
  "SaleStart": "2022-04-03T00:00:00.00+00:00",
  "SaleEnd": "2022-05-03T00:00:00.00+00:00"
  "PriceBreaks": [
    {
      "Quantity": 1,
      "Price": 5.99,
      "SalePrice": 4.99
    }
  ]
}`
}}
/>

## Verify Valid Pricing

Now lets verify that we have successfully created two different price schedules with `SalePrice`s and our product: USB Cord.
The next steps require that you authenticate as specific users.  To check the contents of your authentication token, visit [JWT.io](https://jwt.io).

Lets verify the sale price gets returned.
In the context of Jane Doe from CloudTech, call `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products/usb-product-id`, you should see the USB Cord product returned at the sale price of `"Price": 2.99`.

Lets verify that the product is not on sale
In the context of John Deer from ComputerDudes, call `GET https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io/v1/me/products/usb-product-id`, you should see the same product returned at a _different_ price of `"Price": 5.99`.


## Conclusion

Congratulations!  You now have the knowledge and background to make informed decisions about how to structure your Product -- multiple Price Schedule -- Sale Pricing, and how to make those assignments via the OrderCloud API.
