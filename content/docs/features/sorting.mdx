## Overview

Most OrderCloud Resources include a method for listing items from that Resource. The results returned from a list method have a default sort order, but you can also specify a sort order. Properties marked as “Sortable” in the API Reference can be sorted on.

## Sorting

Perhaps you want to sort the results by the Last Name of the person who placed an order. To do this you can simply include the `sortBy` parameter for the field you would like to sort by.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/me/orders/incoming?sortBy=!LastName HTTP/1.1
```

## Combining Queries

Sorting can be mixed and matched with Searching and Filtering to give you ultimate control when defining what is returned from a list.
