## Overview

Searching data client side can be fine for smaller sets of data but can quickly become unwieldy with large sets of data. To address this issue our API supports server side search queries that do all of the heavy lifting for you.

## Searching

For open-ended, Google-esque searches, simply provide a search term.

Request

This will return all results containing "smith", including "Smith", "Smithers", and "McSmith". The fields searched include `FirstName`,`LastName`, and `UserName`. (This of course varies from endpoint to endpoint. View each <a ui-sref="api-reference">endpoint's documentation</a> for specific details). Fields marked “Searchable” in the API reference will be searched.

You can optionally specify which fields (of the searchable fields available) are searched by providing a `searchOn` parameter for any field available on the resource you're searching.

```http
GET https://api.ordercloud.io/buyers/xyz/users?search=smith&searchOn=LastName,UserName HTTP/1.1
```

## Combining Queries

Searching can be mixed and matched with Sorting and Filtering to give you ultimate control when defining what is returned from a list.
