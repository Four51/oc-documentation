## Overview

Security profiles are groups of roles (permissions), each of which grant users access to specific API endpoints and functionality. This lets you lock down access to your organization at the _API_ level which is very powerful. If a request is made by a user without sufficient roles, they will receive a 403 Forbidden response.
​

## Roles

### Reader and Admin Roles

Most Ordercloud roles fall into one of two categories: Admin and Reader. An **Admin** role allows read and write access to a resource while a **Reader** role allows only read access.
​
For example, a user that is assigned a security profile that has the role `PromotionReader` will be able to List, or Get Promotions but will not be able to modify a promotion by calling Create, Patch, Save, or Delete endpoints.

<!-- TODO:
add image for all security profile roles here, see if we can pull in dynamically from spec so its always current
would be particularly siq if we can make a react component so people can filter them, its probably also pretty easy to
generate a short description for them based on the format of thier name
-->

### Override Roles

Some properties in OrderCloud's data model have been deemed important enough to require a special role in addition to the Admin role for the resource.

<!-- TODO: can we put this in a prettier table? html is valid in markdown and we could even do a react component since we have mdx files -->

| Role                | Effect on assigning the role to a user                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OverrideShipping`  | allows a user to update the `ShippingCost` on an order |
| `OverrideTax`       | allows a user to update the `TaxCost` on an order      |
| `OverrideUnitPrice` | allows a user to update the `UnitPrice` on a line item |

### Me Roles

An astute observer may have noticed that the Me resource has Admin roles but no Reader roles. It is possible to lock down some of the Admin capabilities such as `MeCreditCardAdmin` which would prevent a user from creating personal credit cards however there is no role that would disallow a user from reading anything that is assigned to them. That user would still be able to read any of their own _personal_ credit cards.
​

### DevcenterImpersonate role

In order to make it easier for developers to get in and start testing applications we made a unique role called `DevCenterImpersonate`. This role allows you to log into your application with your DevCenter username and password so you don't have to go through the trouble of creating a user first.
​
To take advantage of this feature simply include the role `DevCenterImpersonate` in the scope of your authentication request
​

### Custom Roles

Custom roles let you lock down access to your app's custom features using Ordercloud's security profiles.
​
These roles are simple string values that will appear on your users' authentication tokens like normal roles. Unlike normal roles, they do not grant access to any API functionality. Instead, use them to control access to your app-specific features. For example, you might want to give some users the ability to place recurring orders (a feature OrderCloud could support, but which has no pre-existing role). You would add a `RecurringOrderAdmin` custom role to a security profile and in your front-end code check that the token contains this string before you let users place a recurring order.
​
Custom roles mean that all your user permission data can live in Ordercloud.
​

## Assigning Security Profiles

Like most things in OrderCloud Security profiles can be assigned at any of the following levels: user, user group, buyer, supplier, or seller level.
​
If your user is assigned more than one security profile, the roles given to that user will be a union of the roles from every assigned security profile.
