## Understanding Access Tokens

Access tokens are what gives you _access_ to parts of the API and must be appended to every request. Encrypted in the token are the identity of the user as well as the roles that the user has access to. Once validated, the OrderCloud API has enough information from this token to determine which endpoints and data a user can read and/or write.

## OrderCloud Workflows

OrderCloud's authentication system is built on top of an open authorization standard called [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) which is increasingly becoming an industry standard for security and permission-based application experiences. OAuth2 provides five different workflows (ways of getting an access token). Additionally, OrderCloud has support for OpenID connect which is an authorization standard built on top of OAuth2 which adds one more workflow bringing our grand tally up to 6 workflows.

- Password Workflow: this is the most common, a user logs in with their username and password
- Client Credentials Workflow: typically used by a backend integration system
- Anonymous Shopping or Guest Checkout Workflow: enable visitors to browse your site without having to register themselves
- Refresh Workflow: securely enable your users to obtain a new access token without having to login again
- Elevated Password Flow: When security really matters. The password flow except with an additional requirement of client secret
- Secure Single Sign-on flow via OpenID Connect (authorization standard built on top of OAuth2)

## API Client

Every authentication request is done through an [API Client](TODO:add-link-to-api-client). If your organization is a house think of an API Client as one of the doors to your house where each door can be configured to allow up to three different types of users from entering: buyers, sellers, and suppliers.

You'll probably have an API Client for your buyer application that only lets buyer users sign in, another one for your seller application that only lets seller users in and possibly one for your integration user which only allows that seller user in.

In general, an API Client is another way defining access to your organization.

### Conclusion

As you can see there are many different ways that you can obtain an access token to _give_ someone access to your organization but what about _limiting_ access to your organization? OrderCloud has a built-in way of handling access to your organization via Security Profiles which we'll talk about next.
