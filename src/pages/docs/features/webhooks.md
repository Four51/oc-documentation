## Overview

Webhooks enable user-defined HTTP callbacks for all writable endpoints in the OrderCloud.io API. Each webhook can be assigned to multiple applications within this Seller Organization.

When a webhook event is triggered on an assigned application, OrderCloud.io will forward the request details to the Payload URL.
